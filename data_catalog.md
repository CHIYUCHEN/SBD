# Milestone 5: Final Report

### Topic: Urban Development and Land Use Patterns in Philadelphia

**Project Overview:**

This project centers on the examination of land use data sourced from Philadelphia, focusing on a dataset of 560,104 records retrieved from the [OpenDataPhilly platform](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/land-use/). The primary aim is to extract meaningful insights by normalizing the data based on the dependent variable's definition. The analysis concentrates on understanding the distribution and attributes of various land use categories, with a specific emphasis on commercial, civic/institutional, and vacant properties.

The project underscores the importance of conducting a thorough analysis of diverse land use aspects across different census tracts to contribute to well-informed decision-making in urban development and planning. The initial focus is on commercial land use, aiming to comprehend its distribution patterns. This analysis aids decision-makers in pinpointing areas suitable for development, redevelopment, or interventions. It also sheds light on census tracts with a lower count of commercial land use, providing crucial insights for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers interested in areas with less prevalent commercial development.

The second aspect involves scrutinizing civic/institutional land use, particularly in library areas. The objective is to gain insights into the distribution of such land use across various census tracts, offering essential information for assessing community access to cultural resources and assisting in formulating policies related to public services.

The third focus revolves around generating a detailed dataset highlighting census tracts containing vacant land. This dataset goes a step further by providing information on the types of vacant buildings within those tracts. The intention is to provide a nuanced understanding of the distribution and characteristics of vacant land within a specified geographic area. This information is considered valuable for urban planning, development, and policy-making, empowering stakeholders to make more informed decisions regarding the utilization of vacant land and the development potential of specific areas.

**Questions:**
1. What is/are the census tract(s) with the lowest count of commercial land use, and what is the respective count of commercial land use in each of these tracts?
   
2. What is the census tract with the largest total area (in square meters) designated as Civic/Institutional land use, specifically for category library area?
   
3. Which census tracts contain vacant landuse with vacant buildings recorded within these tracts?
